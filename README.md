# Arena-Memory
Memory arena (ANCI C), System written in ANSI C based on the @gamedevlog (SMOL Game Engine) video series on Youtube.  

I am a beginner in ANSI C and this code has not been properly tested or optimized, please feel free to do so.  
To compile on Windows, use the "W64devkit" binaries in the system path. It is a set of Linux tools for Windows.  
W64devkit => https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit  
Also an extension of Visual Studio Code "Makefile Tools".
